compute <distance_ID> after <perturbation_ID> at <ps> at <s1>, <s2>,..., <sn>
   evaluates, at the given time step(s), the distance between
   the evolution sequence generated by the loaded model and
   the one obtained by applying the given perturbation at the given time step:
      - <distance_ID> is the name of the distance expression to evaluate;
      - <perturbation_ID> is the name of the perturbation to apply;
      - <ps> in an integer value representing the time step at which <perturbation_ID> is applied;
      - <s1>,... <sn> are integer values representing the time steps at which <distance_ID> is evaluated.

compute <distance_ID> after <perturbation_ID> at <ps> from <from> to <to> every <every>
   evaluates, at the time steps in the given interval, the distance between
   the evolution sequence generated by the loaded model and
   the one obtained by applying the given perturbation at the given time step:
      - <distance_ID> is the name of the distance expression to evaluate;
      - <perturbation_ID> is the name of the perturbation to apply;
      - <ps> in an integer value representing the time step at which <perturbation_ID> is applied;
      - <from>, <to> and <every> are integer values used to compute the time steps at which <distance_ID> is evaluated:
        we have an evaluation every <every> steps in the time interval [<from>,<to>].

check <eval_domain> <formula_ID> <s1>, <s2>,..., <sn>
  evaluates a given RobTL formula,
  according to a given evaluation domain (boolean, or threevalued),
  at the given time step(s):
    - <eval_domain> is the chosen evaluation domain;
    - <formula_ID> is the identifier of the RobTL formula to be evaluated;
    - <s1>,..., <sn> are integer values representing the time steps at which <formula_ID> is evaluated.

check <eval_domain> <formula_ID> from <from> to <to> every <every>
  evaluates, at the time steps in the given interval,
  a given RobTL formula, according to a given evaluation domain (boolean, or threevalued):
    - <eval_domain> is the chosen evaluation domain;
    - <formula_ID> is the identifier of the RobTL formula to be evaluated;
    - <from>, <to> and <every> are integer values used to compute the time steps at which <formula_ID> is evaluated:
      we have an evaluation every <every> steps in the time interval [<from>,<to>].



eval <penalty_ID> at <s1>, <s2>,..., <sn>
   evaluates the given penalty function on the data states reached at the given time steps
   by the evolution sequence generated by the loaded model:
      - <penalty_ID> is the name of the penalty function to evaluate;
      - <s1>,... <sn> are integer values representing the time steps at which <penalty_ID> is evaluated.

eval <penalty_ID> from <from> to <to> every <every>
   evaluates the given penalty function on the data states reached at the time steps in the given interval
   by the evolution sequence generated by the loaded model:
      - <penalty_ID> is the name of the penalty function to evaluate;
      - <from>, <to> and <every> are integer values used to compute the time steps at which <penalty_ID> is evaluated:
        we have an evaluation every <every> steps in the time interval [<from>,<to>].

save in "fileName"

set size = <new_size>
   assigns the given value to parameter size, i.e., the number of samples to be used in the simulations:
      - <new_size> integer value to be assigned to size.

set scale = <new_scale>
