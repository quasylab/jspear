help
   shows the list of commands and their behaviour.

ls
   prints the content of the current working directory.

cwd
   prints the current working directory.

cd "target_dir"
   change the current working directory, "target_dir" can refer to
   either an absolute path or a relative path from the current working
   directory.

load "filename"
   loads the specification in the given file name, penalties: print the
   list of penalty functions defined in the loaded model.

perturbations
   prints the list of perturbations defined in the loaded model.

distances
   prints the list of distance expressions defined in the loaded model.

formulas
   prints the list of formulas defined in the loaded model.

quit
   closes stark interpreter.

eval <perturbation_name> <distance_name> at <s1>, <s2>,..., <sn>
   evaluates the distance between the evolution sequence generated by the
   loaded model and the one obtained by applying the given perturbation at
   the given time steps, where:
      - <perturbation_name> is the name of the perturbation to apply;
      - <distance_name> is the name of the distance expression to evaluate;
      - <s1>,... <sn> are integer values.

eval <perturbation_name> <distance_name> from <s1> to <s2> every <s3>
   evaluates the distance between the evolution sequence generated by the
   loaded model and the one obtained by applying the given perturbation at
   the given time steps, where:
      - <perturbation_name> is the name of the perturbation to apply;
      - <distance_name> is the name of the distance expression to evaluate;
      - <s1>,... <sn> are integer values.
