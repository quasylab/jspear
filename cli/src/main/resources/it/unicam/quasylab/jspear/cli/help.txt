help
   shows the list of commands and their behaviour.

ls
   prints the content of the current working directory.

cwd
   prints the current working directory.

cd "target_dir"
   change the current working directory, "target_dir" can refer to
   either an absolute path or a relative path from the current working
   directory.

load "fileName"
   loads the specification in the given file name.

penalties
   prints the list of penalty functions defined in the loaded model.

perturbations
   prints the list of perturbations defined in the loaded model.

distances
   prints the list of distance expressions defined in the loaded model.

formulas
   prints the list of formulas defined in the loaded model.

compute <distance_name> after <perturbation_name> at <ps> at <s1>, <s2>,..., <sn>
   evaluates, at the given time step(s), the distance between
   the evolution sequence generated by the loaded model and
   the one obtained by applying the given perturbation at the given time step:
      - <distance_name> is the name of the distance expression to evaluate;
      - <perturbation_name> is the name of the perturbation to apply;
      - <ps> in an integer value representing the time step at which <perturbation_name> is applied;
      - <s1>,... <sn> are integer values representing the time steps at which <distance_name> is evaluated.

compute <distance_name> after <perturbation_name> at <ps> from <from> to <to> every <every>
   evaluates, at the time steps in the given interval, the distance between
   the evolution sequence generated by the loaded model and
   the one obtained by applying the given perturbation at the given time step:
      - <distance_name> is the name of the distance expression to evaluate;
      - <perturbation_name> is the name of the perturbation to apply;
      - <ps> in an integer value representing the time step at which <perturbation_name> is applied;
      - <from>, <to> and <every> are integer values used to compute the time steps at which <distance_name> is evaluated:
        we have an evaluation every <every> steps in the time interval [<from>,<to>].

eval <penalty_name> at <s1>, <s2>,..., <sn>
   evaluates the given penalty function on the data states reached at the given time steps
   by the evolution sequence generated by the loaded model:
      - <penalty_name> is the name of the penalty function to evaluate;
      - <s1>,... <sn> are integer values representing the time steps at which <penalty_name> is evaluated.

eval <penalty_name> from <from> to <to> every <every>
   evaluates the given penalty function on the data states reached at the time steps in the given interval
   by the evolution sequence generated by the loaded model:
      - <penalty_name> is the name of the penalty function to evaluate;
      - <from>, <to> and <every> are integer values used to compute the time steps at which <penalty_name> is evaluated:
        we have an evaluation every <every> steps in the time interval [<from>,<to>].

save in "fileName"
   saves the result(s) of the preceding command as a .csv file with the given name.

print
   prints the result(s) of the preceding command.

clear
   resets the default parameters.

quit
   closes stark interpreter.
