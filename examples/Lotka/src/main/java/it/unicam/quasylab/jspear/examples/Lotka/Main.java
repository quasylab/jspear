            cuts a portion of the molecules of Y1 at a given step. In the prey/predator interpretation by Volterra, this
            corresponts to simulate an epidemy affecting the former population.

            both the nominal and the perturbed system: for each time unit in [0,N-1] and for each variable, we store
